## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me

I have extensive experience working with Power BI, Tableau, SQL, Python, and Excel to analyze and present data effectively. As a data analyst, I have a proven track record of transforming complex client information into visually appealing and insightful dashboards. I excel at working with existing Excel spreadsheets and leverage my skills to create powerful Power BI dashboards that present data in a concise and meaningful way
